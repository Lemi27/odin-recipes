# odin-recipes
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s Foundations curriculum. It is a simple web development project designed to help reinforce basic HTML and web structuring skills by creating a recipe website. The website will consist of multiple pages, each showcasing a different recipe with headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:

- Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML elements.
- Organizing content into a logical hierarchy with headings, paragraphs, and lists.
- Embedding images into web pages.
- Creating navigation links between multiple HTML files.
- Developing a foundational understanding of building static websites.
