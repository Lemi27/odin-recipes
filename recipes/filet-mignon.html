        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Broiled filet mignon is an elegant and tender steak dish that exudes sophistication and flavor. Known for its buttery texture and melt-in-your-mouth quality, this cut of beef is celebrated for its natural richness and delicate taste. When broiled, 
            the filet develops a beautifully caramelized exterior while maintaining its juicy, tender interior. Perfectly cooked filet mignon showcases a fine balance of a savory crust and a succulent, medium-rare center that highlights the premium nature of the meat. 
            Itâ€™s a versatile dish that can be paired with a variety of sides, elevating any meal into a gourmet experience.</p>
